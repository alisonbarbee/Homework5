# *The Data*

This data was pulled from a Washington Post study that collected data on more than 52,000 criminal homicides over the past decade throughout some of America's largest cities. This data includes not only the location of the homicide but also includes the status of the case (whether an arrest was made), and some basic demographic information on the victim. The Washinton Post has mapped out each homicide, and identifed the arrest rates by the geography within each city. They shared the data analysis with local police department prior to their publication.

# *Los Angeles Map*

I chose to look through the Los Angeles, CA homicide data to create a map that shows the locations of homicides throughout the city. The layer underneath the data points shows the boundaries of LA county where Los Angeles is located. I used tigris to set county boundaries within California to represent the different subdivisions within the state, then narrowed down to just focus on LA county. I used different facets for the solved verus unsolved homicides and different colors to show the three race groups with the highest number of homicides in LA (Hispanic, Black, and White) and all others are identified as "Other".
